## 🚀 What this integration does

When someone reports an issue, **Videolink bot** automatically suggests recording a short screen + webcam video to demonstrate the problem or explain context.

**Free for open-source projects.**

Once the video is recorded, a **comment with a secure link** appears in the issue thread so everyone can **watch it instantly** - no sign-in required.

Perfect for:
- 🐞 Showing bugs and reproduction steps  
- 💡 Explaining feature requests  
- 🔍 Reviewing pull requests  
- 💬 Async team communication
